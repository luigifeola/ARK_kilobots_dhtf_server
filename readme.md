# Operating multiple physical ARK systems

## Setting up an ARK node as a server

- To run an ARK node as a server you should use the ARK's server experiment code base provided in the ARK_exp_server folder within this repository.
- This experiment code base should be opened and compiled using Qtcreator IDE and then used as any other ARK experiment (see the getting started section above).
- The server node user must note the IP address of their machine to share it with the client user. They must also ensure that the right firewall permissions are enabled to allow the client to communicate with the server.
